# Console-Finances

## Project Objective

To analyze the financial records of a company.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to to analyze the profit and loss data for a company and provide a comprehensive overview for the following:

- Determining the period with the highest profit and the greatest loss.
- Identifying the duration of this period.
- Net profit of the duration.
- Calculating the average difference in income over the entire period.

Learning:
- For each requirement, writing the pseudocode prior to coding was really helpful as it helped me think about what I needed to calculate, how to calculate and then write the code.

- There are so many functions avilable in javascript and there is so much to learn! Learning to being efficient with which method or function to use to execute the code was challenging but at the same time fulfilling!
