# Console-Finances

## Project Objective

To analyze the financial records of a company.

## Description



Learning:

- For each requirement writing the pseudocode in the comments was really helpful to think about what functions I needed to write in the code to enable the feature to function as per expectation.

- There are so many functions avilable in javascript and there is so much to learn! Learning to being efficient with which method or function to use to execte the code was a challenge. I have really enjoyed it.
